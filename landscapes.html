      <p style="color: darkcyan; text-align: left">
        Landscapes are the perfect subject matter for artists. The vibrant
        colors and textures of nature offer landscape painters an infinite
        palette of ideas to play with. Art has the ability to transport the
        viewer to another time and place, to not only see the landscapes that
        famous landscape artists saw but to see the world through their eyes and
        their stylistic interpretations of nature.

            The Hunters in the Snow (winter) (1565) by Pieter Bruegel
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          The Hunters in the Snow was painted with oil onto a wood panel and was
          completed in 1565. The scene in the painting is set in the dead of
          winter and is part of a series of works that represent various times
          of the year, five of which still remain in existence. In Bruegel’s
          era, each period of the year was visually represented by the work done
          by people during those periods, a tradition from the early Renaissance
          known as Labours of the Months. In this specific painting, we can see
          that it is the winter season and three hunters accompanied by their
          dogs are returning from a hunt. The worn-out look of both dog and
          hunter, as well as the single fox’s body, indicate that it was not a
          particularly successful hunt, symbolic of the struggles of the season.

            Entrance to the Grand Canal and the Church of La Salute (c. 1730) by
            Giovanni Antonio Canal
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          Giovanni Antonio Canal was an Italian landscape artist from Venice.The
          Grand Canal at the Church of La Salute is a prime example of a Veduta,
          which is a style portraying realistic landscape paintings. Despite the
          accurate depiction of topographical elements, the painting still
          manages to portray a feeling of splendor and poetic beauty. The
          translucent light casts a warm glow over the scene, creating a sense
          of a city at work in the later hours of the afternoon. The people of
          Venetian society can be seen carrying out their daily duties;
          merchants mingle with travelers from the East and gondoliers can be
          seen leaving the dock and heading to other parts of the city under a
          pale pink setting sun in the distance.

          <div class="desc">View of Toledo (c. 1600) by El Greco</div>
        </div>
        <p>
          El Greco was born in Crete in 1541 and was most active as an artist in
          Spain.Before the change in subject matter that his work brought about,
          landscape art was not a common practice among artists in the western
          part of the world. Scenery and flora and fauna were usually just used
          as a background setting for some kind of human activity.Some have
          speculated that due to the rarity of landscape art prior to El Greco’s
          work, this existing piece might have originally been a part of a
          larger canvas, although there has been no solid proof to back up this
          theory as yet. Others have referred to the View of Toledo as the first
          landscape painting of its time to come out of Spain.Although it might
          seem ridiculous for there not to be a history of landscape artists
          prior to that period, there was a ban on landscape painting by the
          Council of Trent, which seems to be the most likely reason that El
          Greco was the first Spanish artist to do so.

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          The monk in this painting can be seen near the ocean’s edge,
          overlooking a vast and looming scene of a cold and misty morning. The
          monk looks deep in contemplation at the sheer enormity of the
          landscape, aware of his diminished stature compared to such an
          expansive and powerful force as the sea. With its sparse details, the
          viewer is drawn into the elemental turmoil and scale of the painting,
          demanding the viewer to think about their own role within the infinite
          universe. It begs us to ask how we perceive the unpredictable and
          unknown.

        <p>
          John Constable was born in Suffolk, England in 1776, and was an
          English landscape artist.He rose to fame painting the natural scenes
          surrounding his home and is regarded by art historians as being
          responsible for revolutionizing landscape painting as a genre.The Hay
          Wain is one of the most well-known of his landscape paintings. It
          portrays a farm next to the River Stour, which runs between the towns
          of Essex and Suffolk in England. In the center of the piece is a large
          wooden cart being pulled by three horses across the river. The
          landscape depicts an area close to a mill known as Flatford Mill,
          which was owned by Constable’s father.

            The Fighting Temeraire tugged to her last berth to be broken up,
            1838 (1839) by J.M.W. Turner
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          J.M.W Turner was an English artist born in Covent Garden in London,
          1775. He was best known for his imaginative and sometimes violent
          depictions of marine vessels and marine life. Belonging to the English
          Royal Navy, the HMS Temeraire was a second-rate warship with 98 guns.
          Despite the ship’s glorious past, it is depicted in the paintings as
          it is being pulled along by a tugboat on its way to being taken apart
          for scrap. This landscape painting was made in tribute to the last
          days of the magnificent sailing vessels of the day as they made room
          for the new and improved steam-powered models that were taking over.
          The end of the ship’s journey is reflected in the setting sun, marking
          both the end of the day and the end of the vessel’s long and colorful
          journey.

        </div>
        <p>
          Vincent van Gogh was born in Zundert in the Netherlands and was a
          post-impressionist Dutch painter. The Starry Night was painted in 1889
          during van Gogh’s stay at the asylum of Saint Paul, located near
          Saint-Rémy in the south of France, near Provence. It is said to
          portray the view from the window of his room, depicted just before
          sunrise. Although this landscape portrays a brilliantly illuminated
          scene with flowing constellations and waves of blue, the weirdly
          jagged features and out-of-place spirals do hint at the hellish
          turmoil that the landscape painter was experiencing at the time. The
          composition contains an imaginary village that did not exist outside
          of the asylum, but the stars are said to represent real constellations
          that would have been visible.
