      <p class="portheadpara">
        Painted portraits can display more than just a person's appearance. They
        tell us about the person's culture and even a broader retrospective into
        their cultural and societal background. Whether on wooden panels,
        towels, napkins, or whatever canvases were available at hand, by
        painting portraits, artists from all over the globe were responsible for
        immortalizing and documenting human progress. Thus, portrait paintings
        are historically regarded as some of the most important pieces of
        artwork.

            Girl with a Pearl Earring (1665) by Johannes Vermeer
          </div>
        </div>
        <p class="portbodypara">
          The Girl With A Pearl Earring, one of Vermeer's most famous paintings,
          was created in 1665, ten years before his terrible demise. The work
          has gone by several names throughout the ages, and only in the 20th
          century did it receive its current title. A young woman is depicted in
          the painting in a small, dark environment that focuses the viewer's
          attention solely on her. She is decked out in a gold jacket with a
          visible white collar underneath, the titular pearl earring, and a blue
          and gold headpiece. Unlike many of Vermeer's subjects, she is not
          focused on a routine task and unaware of the viewer. Instead, she
          turns her head over her shoulder and meets the viewer's gaze

        <p class="portbodypara">
          Leonardo has frequently been referred to as the prototypical
          "Renaissance man," a person whose seemingly limitless curiosity was
          only surpassed by his inventiveness. He is regarded as one of the
          finest artists and possibly the person with the broadest range of
          talents ever. However, Leonardo was and is primarily known for his
          paintings. The Last Supper and the portrait of the Mona Lisa, two of
          his creations, are arguably the most well-known, frequently imitated,
          and often parodied paintings of all time. Leonardo da Vinci was one of
          the first painters to use aerial perspective. His work was among the
          first portraits to show the subject in front of a made-up landscape.
          Before him, portraits lacked mystery; artists merely depicted physical
          attributes without considering the soul. If they did, they attempted
          to convey the soul through gestures, symbolic items, or inscriptions.
          The Mona Lisa remains a mystery to this day; the soul is present yet
          inaccessible.

            Self-Portrait with Straw Hat (1887) by Vincent Van Gogh
          </div>
        </div>
        <p class="portbodypara">
          Van Gogh painted this self-portrait in the summer of 1887. Around that
          time, it's believed that Van Gogh created at least 27 self-portraits.
          Given that he didn't have to pay models to pose, it was also a
          cost-effective technical practice. Van Gogh's deteriorating state is
          also evident in this particular painting. A man who is under emotional
          and physical strain is indicated by the three-quarter profile, dark
          shadows, and tight jaw. His eyes cast a haunting look that
          simultaneously both begs for human assistance and pushes it away. As
          it befits his self-image as a working man's artist, Van Gogh is
          dressed in the yellow straw hat and work coat of a peasant laborer.

        <p class="portbodypara">
          Louise Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun’s Self-portrait with a Straw Hat
          depicts the well-known French portraitist who was Marie Antoinette’s
          friend and favorite painter. The colors, textures, skin tones, and
          social consequences make up this incredibly captivating self-portrait.
          She is dressed in a dusty pink cotton dress, made popular by Queen
          Marie Antoinette in the 1780s, which is now more often known as a
          chemise à la Reine. It has white frills edging the neckline and wrists
          and white cuffs. The outfit is sharply contrasted by a black shawl
          that wraps over her elbows and hangs below her arm. Her unpowdered
          hair is covered by a flat straw hat. The artist painted herself with
          the elegance and apparel of a respectable aristocratic lady painter.

        <p class="portbodypara">
          Umberto Boccioni is arguably the best example to represent Italian
          Futurism. In his brief life, he created some of the movement's most
          recognizable paintings and sculptures, reflecting the vibrancy and
          energy of contemporary life in a form he hypothesized and defended in
          manifestos, books, and articles. In 1902, he met fellow student Gino
          Severini in the workshop of renowned painter Giacomo Balla. The two
          young artists frequently ventured outside Rome to paint the
          surrounding countryside, as seen in Boccioni's Young Man on a
          Riverbank.

          Lady Agnew (born Gertrude Vernon) is the subject of this painting,
          which was ordered by her husband, the Scottish barrister Sir Andrew
          Noel Agnew. The lady establishes a strong rapport with the observer
          through her direct stare and informal stance. Her exquisite white gown
          with lilac accent blends well with the vibrant, patterned upholstery
          of the Chinese silk wall hanging from the eighteenth century and the
          French chairs. Sargent’s smooth brushstrokes exude an air of luxury
          and comfort.

        <p class="portbodypara">
          Many people think of Vincent van Gogh as the "crazy" artist, the man
          who painted in a frenzy, or just the tortured soul who cut off his
          ear. Those who consider his paintings to be only physical
          representations of his tormented mind frequently overlook his artistic
          brilliance. Throughout his very brief career as an artist, Vincent Van
          Gogh painted between 35 and 40 self-portraits. He completed them all
          between 1885 and 1889.Why Van Gogh created so many self-portraits has
          been the subject of debate among many art historians. They believe the
          artist couldn't afford to hire real models because of his financial
          situation. However, Van Gogh, who was short on money but determined to
          hone his ability as a portrait painter, became his own best model.
